CPLEX and DCSIMSEP
================

If you would like to use the "use_control" options associated with dcsimsep, you will need cplex. 
To do so get cplex from: <http://www-01.ibm.com/software/commerce/optimization/cplex-optimizer/>
and then add the following cplex files to this directory:

The core cplex mex files:
cplexlink125.mexmaci
cplexlink125.mexmaci64

And the interface files:
cplexlp.m
cplexlp.p
cplexoptimget.m
cplexoptimget.p
cplexoptimset.m
cplexoptimset.p
